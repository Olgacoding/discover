                        Indonesia Tourism
                    </h2>
                    <p class="tourism__desc-text">
                        It’s difficult to describe Indonesia in one word. This melting pot island nation is a
                        magnificent conglomeration of cultures, identities and exotica. Indonesia tourism will take you
                        to all parts of the country – islands, cities, towns and villages that are imbued with colour,
                        brimming with stunning sights and scenes and the chance to enjoy life at a different pace. An
                        Indonesia tour might give you the mere highlights about this beautiful country and it will need
                        more than one visit to fully scratch that travel itch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="tourism__desc-text">
                        Indonesia has more than 17,000 islands. Yes, you read that right. This archipelago is heavily
                        populated with a population of 245.5 million. Indonesia tourism covers popular vacation spots
                        such as Bali, Jakarta, Sumatra and Java among several other picturesque places. What you might
                        find interesting is that every city and island is different in Indonesia, each bringing its own
                        unique stamp of culture. The people are friendly and look forward to visits from tourists as
                        Indonesia tourism is one of the biggest sources of revenue for them.

                        Indonesia Geography
                    </h4>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        Located in Southeast Asia, Indonesia lies between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This tropical
                        country straddles the equator and only 6000 of its islands are inhabited. The largest of its
                        islands
                        are Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi and New Guinea. Several of the islands in Indonesia are
                        volcanic
                        islands and the presence of active volcanoes makes the island susceptible to earthquakes and
                        volcanic activity. In fact, there are 400 volcanoes in Indonesia of which 130 are active. Due to
                        the
                        volcanic influence on its soil, Indonesia is home to very diverse flora and fauna and its land
                        is
                        considered very fertile. There are forests in 70% of the country and this adds to its tropical
                        allure.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="tourism__heading">
                        Indonesia Climate
                    </h4>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        Indonesia’s climate is equatorial and thus hot and humid all around. However, the coast and a
                        few
                        other areas receive heavy rainfall as well. Since the country is split by the equator, it
                        experiences different kinds of climates such as tropical rainforest with heavy rainfall,
                        tropical
                        monsoon and tropical savanna. But it can all be narrowed down to two types of climates – wet and
                        dry. Typhoons have been known to strike the islands every now and then between September and
                        December which can bring heavy winds and rainstorms.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        If you’re planning an Indonesia tour, you need to be aware of the kind of climate you’re getting
                        into. It’s best to come prepared with light breathable cotton clothing and it’s a good idea to
                        bring
                        an umbrella or raincoat with you in case there are rains suddenly. If you’re in the mountainous
                        areas, then you will need a sweater. Despite this, be prepared for hot and humid weather at all
                        times during your Indonesia tourism jaunt.
                    </p>

                        Indonesia Culture
                    </h4>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        Indonesia’s culture is varied and rich considering that there are six religions that are
                        followed
                        here along with at least 300 different ethnic groups. It’s hard to pinpoint just a few elements
                        of
                        Indonesian culture as a result. Apart from Islam, the people there follow Christianity, Buddhism
                        and
                        Hinduism to name a few.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        While you are here on your Indonesia tour, do bear in mind that Indonesians have very definitive
                        views on religion and take their religious practices very seriously. The Balinese for instance
                        are
                        very particular about their offerings. Elsewhere, you will see shop owners and employees rush
                        out of
                        their shops during the prayer time. This spiritual aspect of Indonesian life is reflected in
                        everything they do and the way they lead their lives and even build their places of worship.
                    </p>

                        Indonesia Tourism

                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        Indonesia tourism would be incomplete without a mention of the country’s natural beauty. From
                        its
                        mountains and volcanoes to its beaches to its modern cosmopolitan cities, Indonesia has much to
                        offer the weary traveller. A significant part of the revenue of the people here depends on
                        Indonesia
                        tourism..
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="tourism__description">
                        While Bali has its trendy beach resorts, smaller islands like Gili and Batam have their own
                        charms.
                        Jakarta is a metropolis in every possible way while Yogyakarta is known as the epicentre of
                        Javanese
                        fine arts. There are places to visit like Flores Island famed for the Kelimutu volcano caldera
                        or
                        Bukit Lawang with its rehabilitation centre for orangutans. There are several national parks
                        such as
                        Bromo Tengger Semeru with its view of a volcanic crater or the Tanjung Putting National Park in
                        Borneo. One of the famed Indonesia tour spots is the Komodo National Park where Komodo dragons
                        roam
                        freely.

                                Dear Helene – Thank you again for organising this beautiful trip for us! We loved every
                                minute of it. Yes, Bali has changed a lot in the last 20 years, but it is still magical.
                                The amount of tourists was higher than I expected in
                                Ubud, luckily the situation was much better in Munduk, Pemuteran and Sanur.

                                Our trip went smoothly and we received everything that we requested for.
                                My husband and I had
                                an amazing time and we look forward to going back there again to explore other islands
                                that we have not gone to yet with Adventure Indonesia.
                                I would not hesitate to recommend them if you are going.
